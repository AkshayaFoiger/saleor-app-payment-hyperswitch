### Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Setup

1. Create an `.env` file

2. Install dependency

```
pnpm install
```

2. Start the local server with:

```
pnpm dev
```

3. Expose local environment using tunnel:
   Use tunneling tools like [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

4. Install the application in your dashboard:

If you use Saleor Cloud or your local server is exposed, you can install your app by following this link:

```
[YOUR_SALEOR_DASHBOARD_URL]/apps/install?manifestUrl=[YOUR_APP_TUNNEL_MANIFEST_URL]
```

`YOUR_APP_TUNNEL_MANIFEST_URL = TUNNEL_URL/api/manifest`

### Generated schema and typings

Commands `build` and `dev` would generate required schema and typed functions for Saleor's GraphQL endpoint and Hyperswitch's Rest API. Commit the `generated` folder to your repo as they are necessary for queries and keeping track of the schema changes.
